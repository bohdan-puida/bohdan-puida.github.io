<h1>My plans</h1>
<p> Speaking quite frankly, I do not know where the border
  betwixt plans and desires is, especially under current circumstances,
  thus my expectations are down-to-earth respectively. I want to become
  a specialist in IT in order to be competitive in the offers' market.
  And it might sound awkward at first time, but the only thing that really
  attracts me is tourism or so called 'downshifting'. So I want to get enough money to
  travel and converse with interesting people around the world.
